    "The aim of this notebook is to produce animated anomalies of daily maximum temperatures at specific geographical region. Additionally it is meant to show general framework for calculating anomalies with LSA SAF data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Work is based on the LSA SAF Land Surface Temperature - All Sky version 2 (MLST-ASv2) product which is currently in the demonstration phase, i.e. all the data may be subject to a change.\n",
    "\n",
    "Daily maximum temperature is determined from multiple daily temperatures.\n",
    "Similarly maximal temperatures could be obtained by using the [LSA SAF MLST](https://landsaf.ipma.pt/en/data/products/land-surface-temperature-and-emissivity/) product.\n",
    "For the period 2004-2022 the climatology is already pre-calculated and publicly accessible.\n",
    "\n",
    "The focus will be on the heat waves in July and August of 2023 in the Mediterranean region.  Temperatures for July 2023 were much higher than their 1991-2020 averages over southern Europe. Heatwaves were experienced from Spain in the west to the Balkans in the east. In Portugal, France and Italy heatwaves also extend in August.\n",
    "Several temperature records were recorded at the time as described in [reference](https://climate.copernicus.eu/surface-air-temperature-august-2023). \n",
    "\n",
    "The daily maximum temperature wasn't available as an LSA SAF product at the time of production of this notebook, therefore it needed to be determined from multiple temperature measurements. This could be also done using the LSA SAF MLST product, but there could be a potential problem if too many values are missing due to clouds and other obstructions."
